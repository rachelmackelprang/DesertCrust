This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Import metadata
```{r}
des_soil_meta<-read.table(file="~/Dropbox/DesertSoils/DesertSoilMetadata.txt", header=T, row.names = 1, sep='\t')
str(des_soil_meta)
```

Remove variables we don't need. 

```{r}
des_soil_meta_2<-des_soil_meta[,!names(des_soil_meta) %in% c("Seq.Project.ID", "Sample.ID", "Sample.Name", "Collection", "Collection.Day")]
str(des_soil_meta_2)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
